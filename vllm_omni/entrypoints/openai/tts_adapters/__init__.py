"""Registry of TTS serving adapters, and the model detection built on it.

Adapters register themselves by their ``name`` (the model-type discriminator)
via ``@register_tts_adapter``, and declare the deployment metadata that
identifies them: ``stage_keys``, plus ``model_archs`` for the few models a stage
key alone cannot distinguish.

That metadata is the single source of truth. :func:`detect_tts_model_type` and
:func:`all_tts_stage_keys` derive the whole stage -> model-type mapping from it,
so a new TTS model is one adapter file and needs no edit to ``serving_speech.py``.
Models still awaiting an adapter are listed explicitly in
:data:`LEGACY_TTS_DETECTORS`.
