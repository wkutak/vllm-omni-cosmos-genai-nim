# Benchmarking

Benchmarking defines reproducible workloads, metrics, warm-up, measurement,
and result metadata for comparing vLLM-Omni performance.

## Candidate invariants

### BENCH-INV-001: Results are reproducible

**Rule:** Results MUST identify the model, revision, commit, hardware,
configuration, workload, concurrency, warm-up, and measurement window.

### BENCH-INV-002: Correctness precedes performance

**Rule:** A benchmark MUST validate successful and semantically acceptable
outputs before using timings as performance evidence.

### BENCH-INV-003: Metric definitions are explicit

**Rule:** Metrics MUST state their unit, population, and aggregation.

## Safe-change guide

Test workload parsing and metric calculations with deterministic fixtures. Do
not compare materially different workloads or runtime settings.
