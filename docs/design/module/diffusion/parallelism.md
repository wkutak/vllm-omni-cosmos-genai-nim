# Diffusion parallelism

Parallelism owns diffusion rank topology, process groups, tensor and sequence
sharding, collectives, and distributed execution.

## Candidate invariants

### PARALLEL-INV-001: Topology has one source of truth

**Rule:** Rank coordinates, group membership, and parallel dimensions MUST be
derived from validated configuration.

### PARALLEL-INV-002: Sharding contracts are explicit

**Rule:** Every distributed boundary MUST define tensor shape, sharded
dimension, placement, dtype, producer, and consumer.

### PARALLEL-INV-003: Collectives are symmetric

**Rule:** Process-group members MUST invoke compatible collectives in the same
logical order.

### PARALLEL-INV-004: Single-rank behavior remains valid

**Rule:** Distributed implementations SHOULD preserve a supported single-rank
path without distributed initialization.

## Safe-change guide

Test topology validation, single-rank execution, affected parallel modes,
combined modes, invalid shapes, and orderly teardown.
