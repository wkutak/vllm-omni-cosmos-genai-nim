# Observability

Observability defines stable metrics, logs, and correlation fields for tracing a
request across entrypoints, orchestration, stages, and workers.

## Candidate invariants

### OBS-INV-001: Request correlation survives stage boundaries

**Rule:** Logs and metrics for the same request SHOULD carry a stable request
identifier and stage identity.

### OBS-INV-002: Metric meaning is stable

**Rule:** A metric's unit, labels, aggregation, and lifecycle MUST be documented;
changing any of them is a contract change.

### OBS-INV-003: Labels are bounded

**Rule:** Metrics MUST NOT use request IDs, prompts, outputs, or other unbounded
values as labels.

## Safe-change guide

Test registration, label sets, units, lifecycle resets, and representative
multi-stage emission.
